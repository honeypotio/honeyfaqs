# What is Hacker News?
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a news feed aggregator focused on the IT world run by people.
Every day it contains the latest news about new startups, new programming languages and frameworks, sometimes even fintech news, articles regarding the privacy and so on.

Each entry is composed by an external link to the article or a message (i.e. question, polls, etc.) and all the comments written by the community.

Everyone can post new links, that will go straight to the [newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) section.
When they got enough upvotes, links go on the top and could end up to the home page (like reddit, basically), being shown by a huge amount of people around the world.

# What is IRC?
IRC is one of the oldest instant messaging systems.
Comparing to other popular messaging systems (MSN, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Slack...), IRC is distributed, meaning that there is no a single server that hosts the users,
but everyone can create one for free (as in *freedom*). 

# What is Slack?
Slack can be seen as an centralized IRC-based messaging system. It is mostly used though the official client (the Slack app) and allows teams to collaborate together by talking and
sharing files. As IRC, each team (that can be seen as a sort of server) can create channels where they can talk about a topic, there are bots and conversation logs by default.
