# Who are and what they do: System Administrator (SysAdmin), DevOps, Big Data engineers

## System Administrators
System Administrators (or sysadmin) are the people who usually take a "bare metal server", install the software needed to run what he was asked for and maintains it.
A Sysadmin also knows how to tune the software in order to have the maximum performance out of the box and have a somewhat secure server.

## DevOps
A DevOps is a person which is primarily a developer but he has at least some amount of knowledge in the sysadmin area.
Most of the time a DevOps uses tools like chef or puppet to programmatically install and configurate software. In a cloud architecture most of the time he also the architect that choose and create what services to use and what to implement internally.

## Big Data engineers
When you're dealing with a lot of data you can't rely on traditional infrastructures and you need to refactor
all the architecture you need to give the data a meaning.
Big data engineers do exactly that, they can create, manage process to analyze big quantities of data.
