# What is Hacker News?
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) is a news feed aggregator focused on the IT world run by people.
Every day it contains the latest news about new startups, new programming languages and frameworks, sometimes even fintech news, articles regarding the privacy and so on.

Each entry is composed by an external link to the article or a message (i.e. question, polls, etc.) and all the comments written by the community.

Everyone can post new links, that will go straight to the [newest](https://news.ycombinator.com/newest) section.
When they got enough upvotes, links go on the top and could end up to the home page (like reddit, basically), being shown by a huge amount of people around the world.

# What is IRC? And Reddit? And 4chan?
IRC is one of the oldest instant messaging systems.
Comparing to other popular messaging systems (MSN, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Slack...), IRC is distribuited, meaning that there is no a single server that hosts the users,
but everyone can create one for free (as in *freedom*). 

Each server can hosts a large number of *channels*, that are basically rooms where the users can write in to the user guests.
Each channel usually refers to a main topic the guests should talk about and it usually has moderators, on different level.
Usually channels contain also bots, that are fake users that usually do useful things like telling you how's the weather like or googling stuff for you.
Users can also talk each privately. When an user is not connected, s/he won't get the conversation log containing the messages written when s/he was missing.
The only way to do that is being always connected to the channel. There services (either given as "as a service" or self-hostable) that offer users a bouncer,
that is basically a bot that pretends to be you "away from the computer" and saves all the messages on some logs that will be returned to you when you log in next time.

Reddit is a topic-based news feed aggregator. Everyone can post into a *subreddit*, that is a sort of forum on a certain topic which links will be related to.
In the same way of what happens on HackerNews, the entries and the relative comments are upvotable and downvotable. When an entry gets enough upvotes, it will go straight to the homepage.

4chan is one of the oldest image board of the web, inspired to the Japanese 2ch.
The website provides many *boards* related to a topic (like the subbredits) where anonymous users can posts pictures or messages and start in this way a *thread*, with an user
who replies to another one.
4chan is quite popular also for the memes, trolls, flames it generates and spreads for the web.

# What is Slack?
Slack can be seen as an centralized IRC-based messaging system. It is mostly used though the official client (the Slack app) and allows teams to collaborate together by talking and
sharing files. As IRC, each team (that can be seen as a sort of server) can create channels where they can talk about a topic, there are bots and conversation logs by default.
